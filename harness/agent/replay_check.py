"""The replay check: the standing gate a batch of run records passes before any analysis.

Every record of a batch (an OUT directory of the pilot runner, or of the closed-book probe
runner) must load, write back to exactly its stored bytes, and replay offline: an agent run
through the real loop (replay.py), a probe record through the probe's replay (harness/probe). The result
is written beside the records as ``OUT/replay-check.json``:

    {"schema": "replay-check/2", "checked_at", "code": {git_commit, git_dirty, source, tree_sha256},
     "n_records", "n_ok", "failures": [{"file", "stage", "error"}], "hashed_only": [paths],
     "decisions_recomputed", "held", "held_records": [{"file", "run_id", "error", "sha256", "question_id",
     "model", "repetition", "arm", "phase", "code", "tree", "online", "offline"}], "halted",
     "divergence": {"rule", "groups": [...]}, "halt_inputs": [{"phase", "model", "code", "tree", "state", "n"}],
     "set_aside": {arm: {"set_aside", "checker_divergence", "rerun"}},
     "records_sha256"}

``stage`` is ``load`` (not JSON, or not a readable run record), ``roundtrip`` (writing the
loaded record gives other bytes), ``replay`` or ``checker``. A record that holds an online checker
decision has it decided again offline (dress rehearsal F3): the loop's replay serves the decision
back from the record (``RecordedChecker``), so it shows the loop agrees with the decision, never
that the decision was right, and the rehearsal's records, whose checker had failed on every query,
passed it. ``verify_batch(out, recompute=...)`` (harness/checkloop/recompute.py: from the recorded
store responses, with no store and no model) recomputes each such decision; one that diverges
makes the batch HELD (``held``; the diverging records in ``held_records``, each also a ``checker``
failure), and one that cannot be recomputed (no sources given, or not the arm's) is a ``checker``
failure: a checker decision is never passed unverified. ``decisions_recomputed`` counts those that
recomputed to themselves. A record set aside (in ``harness/`` with its sidecar) is not recomputed;
``divergence`` applies the halt rule (see ``divergence_groups``) and ``set_aside`` counts the set-aside
records and their re-runs per arm. ``records_sha256`` is the sha256 of the
compact JSON list of ``[path, sha256 of the file]`` pairs, sorted by path, over every input
of the analysis: the replayed records and the files that are only hashed (``hashed_only``).
Paths are relative to OUT (``records/<run_id>.json``), so a batch extracted from its archive
elsewhere has the same digest.

Replayed: the ``*.json`` files in ``records/``, ``infrastructure/``, ``harness/`` and
``aborted/``. Hashed only: the set-aside decisions (``harness/*.setaside.json``) and the
runner's ``concurrency-events.jsonl``, which the summary reads but which are not records.

Analysis accepts a batch only while (``require_current_check``) its check passed and it is not
held, its inputs
still have that digest (a record or decision changed, added or removed invalidates it), and
the check was made under the code in use, unchanged: the same commit and the same tree digest,
with the code clean. Otherwise verify_batch.py must run again.

The code (``CODE_PATHS``: every file under ``harness/`` and ``scripts/``, ``__pycache__`` and
compiled files left out, ``pyproject.toml``, ``uv.lock``, and the data the harness reads from its
own tree at run time to decide what it does, F1 review item 9: ``data/vocab/`` (the W3C term list
the compiler's rule 36 and the fault bank's conformance read), ``data/tokenizers/`` (the generated
source's token counts) and ``stores/`` (the stores' pinned identities the fault bank's replays
read); not the prompt blocks, each content-addressed, refused on load when its bytes are not its
name, and named in every record) is identified in one of two ways:

* a git checkout: HEAD, clean when git shows no change or untracked file in the code paths;
* a deployed copy without git: the files ``COMMIT`` and ``TREE`` at the code root, written in
  the clean checkout it was copied from, and clean only while the tree digest recomputed from
  the files on disk is the one ``TREE`` names and ``COMMIT`` is the commit ``TREE`` was written
  for (``TREE`` binds the two: ``{"schema": "code-tree/1", "commit", "tree_sha256"}``, F1 review
  item 10; a ``TREE`` of the earlier form, the digest alone, binds nothing and is refused).
  ``COMMIT`` alone is not enough: then git decides.

The tree digest is the sha256 of the compact JSON list of ``[path, sha256 of the file]`` pairs,
sorted by path, over the code files. Deploying to the run host:

    uv run python scripts/write_tree_digest.py          # in a clean checkout: writes COMMIT, TREE
    rsync -a --delete --exclude .git --exclude .venv --exclude '__pycache__' --exclude '*.pyc' \\
        --exclude results --exclude runs ./ HOST:~/www-2027/code/

write_tree_digest.py refuses a checkout with uncommitted changes to the code paths. COMMIT and
TREE are git-ignored; in a checkout that has them they take precedence over git, so a later
commit needs them written again (until then a changed file fails the tree check, never passes).
